# LLM-for-Intent-Classification with GPT-4

This project explored the potential of deploying large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, to perform zero-shot intent classification. 
By introducing a new dataset of 8,453 sentences across 6 distinct intent classes, namely: pets, food, jobs, hobbies, sports, and drinks; our work made two main contributions. 

First of all, we demonstrated that LLMs can indeed perform intent classification tasks through prompting. This aligns with the current trend which aims to exploit the power of in-context learning in LLMs, without the need for for additional fine-tuning. 

Secondly, to test our hypothesis, we introduced a unique dataset that was used to further explore and analyze zero-shot intent classification, providing a valuable resource for the research community.

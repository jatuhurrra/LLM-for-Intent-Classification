In hang gliding early hang gliders had a low lift to drag ratio so pilots were restricted to gliding down small hills.
In hang gliding the lift to drag ratio had significantly improved by the 1980s.
The Federation Aeronautique Internationale and national airspace governing organisations control some regulatory aspects of hang gliding.

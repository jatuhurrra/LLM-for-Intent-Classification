Here are the prompts used in the experiments.

## 1. Zero-shot Standard
This is our standard prompt under zero-shot settings.
```
We want to perform an intent classification task. 
That is, given a sentence, our goal is to predict to which intent class the sentence belongs.
We have 7 intent classes namely: pet, food, job, hobby, sport, drink, other.
Each sentence can only belong to one intent class.

Do not include explanations for the answer. 
Print out only the intent class per sentence. 
Tell me how many predictions you make in total.
```

## 2. Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al.)
This is the few-shot prompting introduced in the paper <b>Chain-of-thought prompting elicits reasoning in large language models</b>.

```
We want to perform an intent classification task. 
That is, given a sentence, our goal is to predict to which intent class the sentence belongs.
We have 7 intent classes namely: pet, food, job, hobby, sport, drink, other.
Each sentence can only belong to one intent class.

The intent classes are described as follows:
pet: this means the sentence contains pets and is talking about pets
food: this means the sentence contains foods and is talking about foods
job: this means the sentence contains jobs and is talking about jobs
hobby: this means the sentence contains hobbies and is talking about hobbies
sport: this means the sentence contains sports and is talking about sports
drink: this means the sentence contains drinks and is talking about drinks
Other: the sentence does not belong to any of the above intent classes

If the sentence belongs to none of the intent classes, that sentence is assigned the intent class "other".
Classify ALL the sentences in column 1 into one of the 7 intent classes namely: pet, food, job, hobby, sport, drink, other. 
Do not include explanations for the answer. 
Print out only the intent class per sentence. 
Tell me how many predictions you make in total.
```

## 3. Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (Kojima et al.)
The paper introduced this technique <b>Large language models are zero-shot reasoners</b>.

```
We want to perform an intent classification task. 
That is, given a sentence, our goal is to predict to which intent class the sentence belongs.
We have 7 intent classes namely: pet, food, job, hobby, sport, drink, other.
Each sentence can only belong to one intent class.

Letâ€™s think step by step.

Print out only the intent class per sentence and do not include explanations for the answer.
Tell me how many predictions you make in total.

## 4. ExpertPrompting
Our study uses two ExpertPrompting methods: <b>Expert-General</b> and <b>Expert-Specific</b>.
ExpertPrompting was introduced in the paper <b>Expertprompting: Instructing large language models to be distinguished experts</b>.

[5. Expert-Specific]
As a Social AI Specialist designing a conversational AI for a social robot in a coffee shop setting, analyze user queries to categorize their intent 
into one of seven categories: pet, food, job, hobby, sport, drink, or other. 
Consider the user's query itself, the casual social context, sentence structure (open-ended vs. specific), and any social cues (formality, emojis) to 
identify the main topic (e.g.,  "hey, what are fun puppy tricks?" classified as "pet"). 
Utilize non-verbal cues (if applicable) and past interactions (if any) for a more nuanced understanding. 
Classify any queries not fitting the predefined categories as "other." 

Classify ALL the sentences in column 1 into one of the 7 intent classes namely: pet, food, job, hobby, sport, drink, other. 
Do not include explanations for the answer.

## 6. Multi-Persona 
Introduced in the paper <b>Unleashing the emergent cognitive synergy in large language models: A task-solving agent through multi-persona self-collaboration</b>.

```
Multi-Persona Prompting for Intent Classification (7 Classes)
Participants:

AI Assistant (You): A large language model with access to a vast amount of text data and capable of understanding natural language.
Topic Classifier: An NLP specialist focused on identifying the main subject or theme of a user query.
Intent Specialist: An expert in understanding the user's goal or desired outcome within a conversation.
Clarification Specialist: An expert in understanding user intent by asking clarifying questions or analyzing conversational context.
Profiles:

AI Assistant (You): You can process user queries and identify keywords, but may struggle to determine the user's ultimate goal or the specific topic of interest.
Topic Classifier: This persona analyzes the query to identify the main subject matter.
Intent Specialist: This persona analyzes the user's phrasing and context to understand their desired outcome (e.g., information, action, social interaction).
Clarification Specialist: This persona identifies ambiguities and can ask clarifying questions or consider the surrounding conversation to pinpoint user intent.
Task: Analyze the following user query and classify its intent into one of the following categories:

Pet: User query relates to pets (e.g., care, training, adoption)
Food: User query relates to food (e.g., recipes, recommendations, preferences)
Job: User query relates to jobs (e.g., searching, applications, careers)
Hobby: User query relates to hobbies (e.g., finding new hobbies, discussing existing hobbies)
Sport: User query relates to sports (e.g., following teams, playing sports, rules)
Drink: User query relates to drinks (e.g., recipes, recommendations, preferences)
Other: User query doesn't fit neatly into the predefined categories.
Collaboration:

AI Assistant (You): The user asks: "What are some fun tricks I can teach my new puppy?"
Topic Classifier: This query focuses on "puppy" and "tricks," suggesting the topic is pets.
Intent Specialist: The user asks about "teaching tricks," indicating they want information on pet training. Their intent is likely Pet.
Clarification Specialist: While the intent seems clear, we could consider asking, "Are you looking for beginner tricks or more advanced ones?" for further refinement.
AI Assistant (You): Based on the combined analysis, the user's intent is classified as Pet. We can incorporate the suggestion from the Clarification Specialist to tailor the response further.
Final Answer:

"Pet" <<

Explanation:

By collaborating with all four personas, you were able to leverage their expertise and achieve accurate intent classification.  The Topic Classifier identified the main subject as pets.  The Intent Specialist confirmed the user's goal as seeking information related to pet training.  The Clarification Specialist offered an optional step for additional refinement.  This multi-faceted approach ensures a robust intent classification system for your dataset.

Note: Remember to adapt the user query and expected intent category throughout your actual application based on your specific dataset.

Rabbits and have been kept as pets in Western nations since the 19th century.
"Rabbits can be housed in exercise pens, but free roaming without any boundaries in a rabbit-proofed space has become popularized on social media in recent years."
"Beginning in the 1980s, the idea of the domestic rabbit as a house companion, a so-called house rabbit similar to a house cat was promoted."
"Rabbits can be litter box-trained and taught to come when called, but they require exercise and can damage a house that has not been ""rabbit proofed"" based on their innate need to chew."
"Accidental interactions between pet rabbits and wild rabbits, while seemingly harmless, are usually strongly discouraged due to the species' different temperaments as well as wild rabbits potentially carrying diseases."
"Unwanted pet rabbits end up in animal shelters, especially after the Easter season."
Some of the pet rabbits go on to be adopted and become family pets in various forms.
Because their wild counterparts have become invasive in Australia then pet rabbits are banned in the state of Queensland.
"Pet rabbits being a domesticated breed that lack survival instincts, do not fare well in the wild if they are abandoned or escape from captivity."
Pet rabbits were the third most abandoned pet in the United States in 2017.
Rabbits are easily litter box trained.
"Rabbits that live indoors may be less exposed to the dangers of predators, parasites, diseases, adverse weather, and pesticides, which in turn increases their lifespan."
"Rabbits are often compatible with others of their kind, or with birds or guinea pigs but opinion differs regarding the dangers of housing different species together."
"For example, while rabbits can synthesize their own vitamin C guinea pigs cannot so the two species should not be fed the same diet."
"Also, most rabbits tend to be stronger than guinea pigs so this may cause deliberate or inadvertent injury."
Some people consider rabbits a pocket pet even though they are rather large.
Keeping a rabbit as a house companion was popularised by Sandy Crook in her 1981 book Your French Lop.
"In the late 1980s, it became more common to litter box train a rabbit and keep it indoors."
"Rabbits are alert, timid creatures that startle fairly easily, and many of their behaviors are triggered by the fight-or-flight response to perceived threats."
"According House Rabbit Society the owner of a pet rabbit can use various behavioral approaches to gain the animal's trust and reduce aggression, though this can be a long and difficult process."
"There is evidence to suggest that young rabbits that occupy the periphery of the ""litter huddle"" obtain less milk from the mother and, as a result, have a lower weight."
Rabbits need regular checkups at the veterinarian because they may hide signs of illness or disease.
"Additionally, rabbits need regular maintenance in the form of being able to chew on something and having their nails trimmed regularly."
"Pet rabbits can often exhibit behaviour problems, including aggression towards humans and conspecifics, particularly with poor husbandry."

"ferrets may have been domesticated since ancient times, but there is widespread disagreement because of the sparseness of written accounts and the inconsistency of those which survive."
"Contemporary scholarship agrees that ferrets were bred for sport, hunting rabbits in a practice known as rabbiting."
"In North America, the ferret has become an increasingly prominent choice of household pet, with over five million in the United States alone."
"The domestic ferret is often confused with the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), a species native to North America."
